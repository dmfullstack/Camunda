## Technical environment
- [camunda BPM platform 7.0.0-Final](http://camunda.org) (tested on JBoss AS 7)

## The Process

![Bank Account Opening][1]

A lot of banks provide their customers with an online form to sign up for a new bank account. However, before the bank account can officially be opened, the banks need to verify the person's identity. The methods of identity verification vary from country to country, one commonly used term being "notarized letter", which means that a letter is signed by an official witness (e.g. a lawyer) who verifies a person's identity. In Germany, this service is called "postident" and is provided by post offices. That's what we'll be using in this showcase.

The BPMN diagram shows the resulting process with all it's technical ins and outs. Orders to open a bank account can be submitted through the website or a legacy system like e.g. FTP. The website produces Java objects while the orders arrive as XML documents on the FTP server.

Since the management is interested in the time it typically takes from the initial creation of a bank account until the identity documents arrive, we decided to implement those steps as an executable business process. This will automatically store the time stamps of each step in a database and thus make it easy to write some monitoring and reporting later on. However, there are also some data transformation steps before a process can be started and we need to poll folders for incoming files. These are tasks that Apache Camel is really good at, so we decided to combine the process engine with Camel.

There is a possible extension: You can add JMS queues to the game if you want to - this is explained further down this readme.

## Getting Started

* Download the [camunda BPM platform](http://camunda.org/) for JBoss AS 7 **(tested on 7.0.0-Final)** from [here](http://camunda.org/download.html) and install it.
* Clone this repository
* Open  `src/main/resources/route.properties` with a text editor and replace the  `folder.orders` and  `folder.postident` properties with the directories you would like to use as hot-folders for the showcase
* Build the application with `mvn package`
* Copy the generated WAR artifact to the JBoss AS 7 deployment directory `<CAMUNDA_BPM_PLATFORM_HOME>/server/jboss-as-7.1.3.Final/standalone/deployments/`
* Ready! You should see the following logs in the server

```

```


## Starting a process instance via REST

Use your favorite REST/HTTP client (curl, chrome rest client, cocoa rest client to name a few) to place a HTTP PUT request:

- method: `PUT`
- URL: [http://localhost:8080/bank-account-opening-camel/rest/orders/](http://localhost:8080/bank-account-opening-camel/rest/orders/)
- Header: `Content-Type: application/json`
- Request Body (example): 

```  
{
	"accounttype": "saving",
	"address": {
			"city": "The City",
			"country": "The Country",
			"number": 1,
			"state": "The State",
			"street": "The Street",
  			"zipcode": "1234"},
	"ordernumber": "0001",
	"person": {
		"dateofbirth": "2012-08-16T13:26:38.551Z",
		"email": "john.doe@somecompany.com",
		"firstname": "John",
		"gender": "male",
		"lastname": "Doe",
		"phonenumber": "123456",
		"placeofbirth": "Some Place",
 		"title": "Mr."}
}
```

If you use CURL you might want to use this:

```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -vd "{\
 \"person\" : {\
 \"gender\" : \"male\",\
 \"lastname\" : \"Doe\",\
 \"firstname\" : \"John\",\
 \"title\" : \"Mr.\",\
 \"email\" : \"john.doe@somecompany.com\",\
 \"placeofbirth\" : \"Some Place\",\
 \"phonenumber\" : \"123456\",\
 \"dateofbirth\" : 1345123598551\
 },\
 \"address\" : {\
 \"street\" : \"The Street\",\
 \"number\" : 1,\
 \"city\" : \"The City\",\
 \"country\" : \"The Country\",\
 \"zipcode\" : \"1234\",\
 \"state\" : \"The State\"\
 },\
 \"accounttype\" : \"saving\",\
 \"ordernumber\" : \"0001\"\
}" http://localhost:8080/bank-account-opening-camel/rest/orders/
```



## Starting a process instance via XMl in drop folder 

Remember: You configured the according folder in the `route.properties` file. You can use this example as a basis:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<order ordernumber="0001">
	<person>
		<firstname>John</firstname>
		<lastname>Doe</lastname>
		<title>Mr.</title>
		<dateofbirth>2012-04-27T12:30:23.998+02:00</dateofbirth>
		<placeofbirth>Somewhere</placeofbirth>
		<gender>male</gender>
		<phonenumber>123456</phonenumber>
		<email>john.doe@company.com</email>
	</person>
	<address>
		<street>The Street</street>
		<number>1</number>
		<zipcode>1234</zipcode>
		<city>The City</city>
		<state>The State</state>
		<country>The Country</country>
	</address>
	<accounttype>debit</accounttype>
</order>
```



**Order Number as Correlation ID:** Note that we are using the "ordernumber" attribute to correlate the "postident" document with the initial order. That means that the order number has to be unique for each submitted bank account order. Orders with existing order numbers will be accepted by the web-service but end up in a dead letter queue.




## Correlate Postident PDF to process instance via drop folder 

In order to move on the process instance waiting for postident

* Copy a file named `something-0001.pdf` to the drop folder you configred for postident. The `0001` must match the order number you set when creating the process instance.


## Check Tasklist

Now you can check the task created in the [camunda Tasklist](localhost:8080/camunda/app/tasklist/). 

You can approve or not approve the account - check the server logs for the according actions. 


## The big picture as BPMN collaboration

## Add JMS (optional)

In the example you can easily add JMS. Currently we used the Camel [SEDA Component](http://camel.apache.org/seda.html) instead of JMS to allow running this example
on containers without JMS configured. 

If you want to replace SEDA with JMS you have to do several steps:

* Configure JMS in your server, we explain it for JBoss AS 7.
* Configure Camel to use JMS from JBoss AS 7.
* Send JMS message (instead of SEDA) when retrieving an order via REST API.

### Add JMS Queues to your server

Configure your JBoss to use the **full profile**, therefor start the server by by typing `./standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml` (Linux/Unix/Mac) or `standalone.bat -c standalone-full.xml` (Windows) in `<CAMUNDA_BPM_PLATFORM_HOME>/server/jboss-as-7.1.3.Final/bin`

Edit the standalone-full.xml and add:

```xml
<jms-queue name="orderQueue">
	<entry name="queue/order"/>
    <entry name="java:jboss/exported/jms/queue/order"/>
</jms-queue>
<jms-queue name="xmlQueue">
	<entry name="queue/xml"/>
    <entry name="java:jboss/exported/jms/queue/xml"/>
</jms-queue>
```

You might not yet have any queues in your JBoss - in this case add a `<jms-destinations>` as last element within the `<hornetq-server>` element:

```xml
<hornetq-server>
    ....
    <jms-destinations>
		<jms-queue name="orderQueue">
			<entry name="queue/order"/>
		    <entry name="java:jboss/exported/jms/queue/order"/>
		</jms-queue>
		<jms-queue name="xmlQueue">
			<entry name="queue/xml"/>
		    <entry name="java:jboss/exported/jms/queue/xml"/>
		</jms-queue>
	</jms-destinations>
</hornetq-server>	
```

### Configure Camel to use JMS from JBoss AS 7

Edit [BootStrap.java](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-consulting/blob/master/showcases/bank-account-opening-camel/src/main/java/org/camunda/demo/camel/BootStrap.java) and 
remove the SEDA code and uncomment the code for JMS:

```java
JmsComponent jmsComponent = cdiCamelContext.getComponent("jms", JmsComponent.class);
jmsComponent.setConnectionFactory(queueConnectionFactory)
```

### Send JMS message

Edit [OrderJmsService.java](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-consulting/blob/master/showcases/bank-account-opening-camel/src/main/java/org/camunda/demo/camel/jms/OrderJmsService.java) and 
remove the SEDA code and uncomment the code for JMS.

Redeploy everthing. If that works without errors: Congratulations - you know use JMS!
