# Showcase of "Incident Management" process from official "BPMN 2.0 by Example" document

Camunda contributed the "Incidement Management" process to the official OMG document ["BPMN 2.0 by Example"](http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/20100601/10-06-02.pdf). This process shows a complete collaboration of different human actors with an IT system. This is explained briefly in [this blog post](http://www.bpm-guide.de/2010/07/15/bpmn-2-0-am-beispiel-incident-management/) or in more depth in our [Real-Life BPMN book](http://www.amazon.com/Real-Life-BPMN-Analyze-Automate-Processes/dp/1480034983/).
