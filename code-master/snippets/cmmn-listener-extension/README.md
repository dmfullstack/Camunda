# CMMN Human Task Listener in a Process Engine Plugin
This Process Engine Plugin registers a TaskListener for every Human Task in all cases that are deployed to the engine.

As Human Tasks are handled as User Tasks in processes, you can reuse your existing task listeners.

No need to model this task listener explicitly in every human task any more.

## How does it work?

The [CmmnTransformerProcessEnginePlugin](src/main/java/com/camunda/consulting/cmmn_listener_extension/CmmnTransformerProcessEnginePlugin.java) registers the [ExampleCmmnTransformListener](src/main/java/com/camunda/consulting/cmmn_listener_extension/ExampleCmmnTransformListener.java), which is the corresponding part to a BpmnParseListener. Here you add your [ExampleTaskListener](src/main/java/com/camunda/consulting/cmmn_listener_extension/ExampleTaskListener.java).

When a new case definition is deployed, the listener is added to every human task in the case. You don't need to model them explicitly.

## How to use it?
To get started refer to `InMemoryH2Test` and `camunda.cfg.xml`.

Run the test and inspect the console output to see the listener working.

For using it in production you have to [integrate the plugin into your Camunda BPM configuration](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/process-engine-plugins/).
