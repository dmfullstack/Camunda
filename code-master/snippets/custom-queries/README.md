# Introduction
This quickstart shows how to query tasks together with domain objects and
make restrictions on domain object attributes as well. This is a typical
requirement to allow writing task lists that perform well

# Environment Restrictions
None

# Remarks to run this quickstart
There is no web interface to access the application, please refer to the Arquillian Test case to get started, which by
default connects to a local running fox platform on JBoss AS 7.


# Extension Points / Ideas:
- Add all task parameters to query / variable amount of parameters (how to get around that we cannot add own query objects or show how to hook in own query objects in the platform)
- Query all Variables at once (how to get paging working correctly) 


# Known Issues:
