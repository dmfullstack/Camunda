# Email Incident Handler Plugin
This process engine plugin sends out repeating emails after an incident is unresolved about a certain time.

## Show me the important parts!

A [custom incident handler](src/main/java/com/camunda/consulting/email_incident_handler_plugin/EmailIncidentHandler.java) creates a job in the database, which is handled by a [custom job handler](src/main/java/com/camunda/consulting/email_incident_handler_plugin/ReminderEmailJobHandler.java) to send out an email when it is due.

## How does it work?

The EmailIncidentHandler extends the DefaultIncidentHandler to create a job, when the incident occurred. (see`handleIncident(IncidentContext context, String message)`)

The Job is cerated with a new JobHandlerType `reminder-job`. The implementation sends out an email (in the example it writes a message in the log) when the job is due. See `ReminderEmailJobHandler.execute()` for further details. The ReminderEmailJobHandler extends the TimerEventHandler to reuse the repeat features of timer events.

## How to use it?

You have to implement the sending of emails according to your infrastructure.

You have to configure the cycle of sending around the emails. There is a constant `REMINDER_MINUTES` in the `EmailIncidentHandler` to configure this. Maybe you will get the value from another configuration.

To get started refer to `InMemoryH2Test` and `camunda.cfg.xml`.
For using it in production you have to [integrate the plugin into your Camunda BPM configuration](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/process-engine-plugins/).
