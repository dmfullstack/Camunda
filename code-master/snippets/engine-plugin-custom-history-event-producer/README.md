# Camunda BPM Process Engine Plugin
A Plugin for [Camunda BPM](http://docs.camunda.org). Example on how to implement a CustomHistoryEventProducer to add properties to the history events that are not saved there by default.
In this example we add the authenticated user as a taskAssignee for a message correlation. This way we can see which user initially correlated the message by filtering by taskAssignee though it's no task. This is just an abstract example but can help to think about new ways of customizing the history.

This project has been generated by the Maven archetype
[camunda-archetype-engine-plugin-7.6.1](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).
