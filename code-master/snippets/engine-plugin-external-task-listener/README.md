# Camunda External Task Listener Plugin
A Process Engine Plugin for [Camunda BPM](http://docs.camunda.org) that allows listening to newly created External Tasks.
It also provides a way to complete External Tasks without locking them via `ExternalTaskService.fetchAndLock()`.
This could be used to signal an External Task Worker that is running inside the same JVM
and to save the database transaction of `ExternalTaskService.fetchAndLock()`.

This project has been generated by the Maven archetype
[camunda-archetype-engine-plugin-7.11.1](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).
