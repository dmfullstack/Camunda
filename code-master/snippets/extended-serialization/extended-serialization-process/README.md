Sample process application for extended-serialization
=========================

This is a process application to show the serialization of a process variable built from a complex java object.

See the [ComplexDataObject](src/main/java/com/camunda/consulting/extendedSerializationProcess/ComplexDataObject.java) for the attributes of the process variable.

In the example process, the object is stored in a variable on the first service task by calling a expression on a named bean:

    <bpmn2:serviceTask id="ServiceTask_1" camunda:expression="${complexObjectCreator.create()}" camunda:resultVariable="complexValue" name="Create Complex Object">
    </bpmn2:serviceTask>    

This object creation can be mocked in a JUnit test as you can find [here](src/test/java/com/camunda/consulting/extendedSerializationProcess/nonarquillian/InMemoryH2Test.java)

This project has been generated by the Maven archetype
[camunda-archetype-ejb-war-7.2.1](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

How does it work?
-----------------


How to use it?
--------------

There is no web interface to access the application.
To get started refer to the `InMemoryH2Test`.

There is also an `ArquillianTest`, which by default connects to a
Camunda BPM platform running locally on a JBoss AS 7.
You can download a Camunda BPM distribution for JBoss from the
[Camunda BPM download page](http://camunda.org/download/).

You can also use `ant` to build and deploy the example to an application server.
For that to work you need to copy the file `build.properties.example` to `build.properties`
and configure the path to your application server inside it.
Alternatively, you can also copy it to `${user.home}/.camunda/build.properties`
to have a central configuration that works with all projects generated by the
[Camunda BPM Maven Archetypes](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

Once you deployed the application you can run it using
[Camunda Tasklist](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#tasklist)
and inspect it using
[Camunda Cockpit](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#cockpit).
