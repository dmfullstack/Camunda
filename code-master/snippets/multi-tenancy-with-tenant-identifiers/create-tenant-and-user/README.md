# Camunda BPM Process Application: Multi tenancy with tenant identifiers
A Process Application for [Camunda BPM](http://docs.camunda.org).

This project has been generated by the Maven archetype
[camunda-archetype-servlet-war-7.5.0](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

## Show me the important parts!
![BPMN Process](src/main/resources/process.png)

## How does it work?

Use the process application together with the example registration front end under [src/main/webapp/online](src/main/webapp/online/index.html) to create new tenants as well as users that belong to that tenant.

## How to use it?
Build and deploy the project using `maven` and run it on your local camunda server.

You can also use `ant` to build and deploy the example to an application server.
For that to work you need to copy the file `build.properties.example` to `build.properties`
and configure the path to your application server inside it.
Alternatively, you can also copy it to `${user.home}/.camunda/build.properties`
to have a central configuration that works with all projects generated by the
[Camunda BPM Maven Archetypes](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

Once you deployed the application you can run it using
[Camunda Tasklist](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#tasklist)
and inspect it using
[Camunda Cockpit](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#cockpit).
