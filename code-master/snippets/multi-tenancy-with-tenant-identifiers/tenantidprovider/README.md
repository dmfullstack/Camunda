# Global Tenant ID Provider for Camunda BPM
Use with [Camunda BPM](http://docs.camunda.org).

This project has been generated by the Maven archetype
[camunda-archetype-servlet-war-7.5.0](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

## How does it work?

The tenant ID provider resolves the tenant ID of an authenticated user when starting a new process instance for a specific tenant. This is especially useful for shared process definitions that have been deployed without a tenant ID.


## How to use it?

Implement the SPI `TenantIdProvider` and include it in your `ProcessEngineConfiguration`. Alternatively, provide it as a process engine plugin.
