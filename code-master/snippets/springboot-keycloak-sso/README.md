## Integrating Keycloak with Camunda using the Keycloak Spring Boot adapter

This is another example of how to achieve SSO with Camunda. There are two flavours of this snippet: one for the [plain Spring Boot adapter for Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/index.html#_spring_boot_adapter) and one that integrates with [Keycloak's Spring Security adapter](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/index.html#_spring_security_adapter).

The example also uses the [camunda-identity-keycloak plugin](https://github.com/VonDerBeck/camunda-identity-keycloak) from the community.

Another example of how to use external authentication can be found in the [Camunda SSO JBoss Project](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-sso-jboss) or the [Camunda Spring Security Example](https://github.com/camunda-consulting/code/tree/master/snippets/springboot-security-sso).
