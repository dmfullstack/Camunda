# Event Sub-Process Example
A Process Application for [Camunda BPM](http://docs.camunda.org).

This project has been generated by the Maven archetype
[camunda-archetype-servlet-war-7.3.2](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

## Show me the important parts!
The first process is started with a BPMN file a DMN file or both, it then displays those to a user as an embedded tasklist form to be validated.
If anything was validated it is then deployed via a service task.

The second process lists all deployed BPMN processes and DMN tables and offers the ability to "undeploy" any of the available options (or none)
![BPMN Process](src/main/resources/remove-deployment.svg)

## How does it work?
This is a simple process which demonstrates how you can upload a BPMN 2.0 file, have it reviewed and the choose to deploy it. 
This demonstrates a few interesting implementations such as:

+ uploading a file
+ embedding bpmn.io into an embedded form
+ deploying a new process definition with a bpmn file using the Java API
+ removing a deployed process definitino using the Java API


## How to use it?
There is no web interface to access the application.
To get started refer to the `InMemoryH2Test`.

You can also use `ant` to build and deploy the example to an application server.
For that to work you need to copy the file `build.properties.example` to `build.properties`
and configure the path to your application server inside it.
Alternatively, you can also copy it to `${user.home}/.camunda/build.properties`
to have a central configuration that works with all projects generated by the
[Camunda BPM Maven Archetypes](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

Once you deployed the application you can run it using
[Camunda Tasklist](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#tasklist)
and inspect it using
[Camunda Cockpit](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#cockpit).
